# EzItems REST API Frontend

## Description

This is the frontend of the EzItems REST API. With the frontend the user
can add, delete, update, and view items. Changes are reflected to the database.

## Technologies

- **Node.js**
- **React**

## Features

- User can add items that have name, price and picture.
- User can delete items.
- User can update items. (All fields must be filled to avoid empty fields.)
- Items are constantly rendered so that the user can view them.

## Problems

Sadly I couldn't get search to work. The initial idea was
that the user could search from the help section with appropriate keywords.
